# Wrapify

A side project to practice on Jetpack Compose.

You need to supply keys for Spotify API. You can find information about how to gain access by using the [link](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

When you obtain the keys, you can provide them to the app by putting the following in the `local.properties` project root file:

```properties
#Spotify API KEYS
spotify_client_id = <insert>
spotify_client_secret = <insert>
```
